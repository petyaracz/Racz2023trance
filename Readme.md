We want to look at two questions. What sort of social factors have been
proposed to co-occur with trance and possession phenomena? Using the
Ethnographic Atlas and the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, can we get
more confident that these factors do co-occur with such phenomena across
cultures?

## 1. Trance and possession phenomena have societal covariates in the literature

Many people have argued that trance induced by possession is not a
random, idiosyncratic pathology but a recurrent psycho-social trait that
is at least partly motivated by other social factors.

High overall social complexity and social rigidity – the resulting power
dynamics – might translate to possession trance practices. Such
practices might serve to express or relay perceived social inflexibility
and inequality. This is echoed in the medical anthropology literature
(During et al. (2011),Dein, Cook, and Koenig (2012)) and ties in with
broader questions of inequality and mental health (Nguyen and Peschard
(2003)). Various causative models have been proposed to account for the
emergence of possession trance and, specifically, shamanism in a social
setting (M. Winkelman (2015), Singh (2018), C. Wood et al. (2018)).

Some or most groups can feel stuck in a society. If this makes trance
and possession more likely, we should see correlations between measures
of social complexity, organisation, and inequality and possession and
trance in cross-cultural data. Many such correlations have been proposed
by previous work. Here is a list, cross-referenced with C. P. Wood and
Stockly (2018):

| Relationship                                                 | Reference                     |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| Social complexity, rigidity, gender role differentiation     | Bourguignon (1968)            |
| Women’s social participation                                 | Bourguignon (1973)            |
| Slavery, role differentiation, and structure differentiation | Greenbaum (1973)              |
| Increased social participation                               | Swanson (1978)                |
| Social complexity                                            | M. J. Winkelman (1986)        |
| Social flexibility, cognatic kinship                         | Shaara (1992)                 |
| Decreased social participation                               | Douglas (2004)                |
| Social rigidity, monotheism                                  | C. P. Wood and Stockly (2018) |

Several works made the same point or emphasised various aspects of the
same relationship. The above table is somewhat reductive.

## 2. This can be mapped to the Ethnographic Atlas

The use of cross-cultural typological data in general and the
Ethnographic Atlas in particular has precedents. Bourguignon (1968),
Bourguignon (1973), and Greenbaum (1973) use the Ethnographic Atlas to
look for correlates of trance and possession trance. C. P. Wood and
Stockly (2018), Shaara (1992), M. J. Winkelman (1986), and Douglas
(2004) build on this research by specifying and compiling their own data
sets. The present paper uses the Ethnographic Atlas as made available in
the D-Place database, Kirby et al. (2016).

The Atlas records the presence of trance and possession phenomena in a
given society, using the following variable (EA112):

| Coding | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | possession_trance | n in EA | n in SCCS |
|-------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------|--------:|----------:|
|      1 | Trance behavior is known to occur, but there is no belief in possession.                                                                                                                                                                       | other             |     135 |        26 |
|      2 | A belief in possession exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | other             |      45 |         9 |
|      3 | Trance behavior is known to occur and is explained as due to possession. There is no possession belief referring to other experiences and there are no trance states with other explanations.                                                  | possession trance |      67 |        10 |
|      4 | Two types of trance states are known to occur. One which is explained as due to possession and one which is given another type of explanation. In addition to explaining trance, possession belief also refers to one or more other phenomena. | possession trance |      93 |        31 |
|      5 | There is both a trance state and a belief in possession, but this belief refers to phenomena other than trance, which is explained through other categories.                                                                                   | other             |      79 |        27 |
|      6 | Trance explained as due to possession is known to occur, and there are no other trance states, but cases of possession outside of trance are also believed to occur.                                                                           | possession trance |      85 |        25 |
|      7 | Trance states of two kinds are known to occur, some of which are explained by possession. No other phenomena are explained by possession.                                                                                                      | possession trance |      36 |         5 |
|      8 | No trance states of any kind are known to occur, and there is no belief in possession.                                                                                                                                                         | other             |     118 |        18 |

This is basically a truth table of whether possession beliefs or trance
states are present in a given society, with some causal links between
the two (if possession happens it leads to trance, if trance happens
it’s because of possession, etc). We can think of different groupings
(trance phenomena encompass levels 1,3,4,5,6,7, possession phenomena
encompass 2,3,4,5,6,7, specifically possession trance covers 3,4,6,7 but
not 1,2,5,8).

The Atlas lists a set of variables that tie in with the observed
covariates in the literature. These are either taken literally from
Bourguignon (1968), Bourguignon (1973), and Greenbaum (1973) or adapt
variables used by C. P. Wood and Stockly (2018), Shaara (1992), M. J.
Winkelman (1986), and Douglas (2004).

See the variable ““Jurisdictional hierarchy beyond the local community”” for information on organization beyond the local community. Note that different types of organization on the same level, e.g., a consanguineal lineage and its localized equivalent, are counted as one, and organizations not held to be legitimate, e.g., imposed colonial regimes, are excluded.                   |
| EA033 | Jurisdictional hierarchy beyond local community | The number of jurisdictional levels beyond the local community, with 1 representing the theoretical minimum (e.g., none/autonomous bands or villages) and 4 representing the theoretical maximum (e.g., villages nested within parishes, districts, provinces, and a complex state). This variable also provides a measure of political complexity, ranging from 1 for stateless societies, through 2 or 3 for petty and larger paramount chiefdoms or their equivalent, to 4 or 5 for large states. Note that different types of organization on the same level are counted as one, and organizations not held to be legitimate, e.g., imposed colonial regimes, are excluded. |

## 3. How do we look for correlations between trance and possession and their proposed societal covariates?

There are eight types of trance and possession phenomena recorded in the
Atlas and a wide set of possible covariates, all with a number of levels
(see the Appendix).

The data are challenging in two ways. The variables are themselves
correlated, either because they measure different facets of the same
thing (like how complex a society is; see the figure below) or because
they were adapted together by socially or geographically close societies
(Galton’s problem). In addition, data are missing from the Atlas in a
non-random manner (e.g. if a society is hard to access, it is harder to
provide a population size estimate for it).

We can account for Galton’s problem (geographic and cultural
co-variation) by restricting our initial data to societies in the
Standard Cross-Cultural Sample.

The remaining co-variation and the non-random patterns of missing data
recommends an ensemble learning method. This starts with societies with
information on trance and possession phenomena and builds a lot of tiny
models, using random samples of the data and random subsets of the
covariates. Then, we compare these models to assess the overall
importance of our covariates. Building little models in parallel is
called bagging. This is how a random forest works, growing many
classification or regression trees and aggregating over the results. One
step further is to train models on the mistakes of the previous models.
This is called [boosting](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/boosting) and
usually results in higher training and prediction accuracy.

## 4. Building a boosting model

In this analysis, we will use a gradient boosting model on the data from
the Ethnographic Atlas, subsetting it to only include societies in the
Standard Cross-Cultural Sample.

Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning method which uses decision
trees. A decision tree is a directed tree graph in which each node
represents a decision or split based on a predictor variable and each
leaf is an individual data point. It can be used to classify leaves by
grouping them under different node structures. A gradient boosting
algorithm fits such trees in a sequence, training each on the errors of
the previous one, minimising overall error. It stops when further
iterations do not result in meaningful improvement on model accuracy
(according to pre-set criteria) Smith (2017).

We only fit the model on societies which (a) have information on whether
trance and possession phenomena are present and (b) come from the
standard cross-cultural sample.

Following Bourguignon (1968), we reduce the complexity of the outcome
variable to two levels: whether a society has possession trance or not.
The predictors are the possible covariates identified above. Some
predictors, like `EA032` (Jurisdictional hierarchy of local community)
or `EA113` can be construed to follow a scale. These are input as
ordered factors. Others, like `EA053` (Sex differences in animal
husbandry) or `EA043` (Major type of descent) can be carved up into
categories: These are one-hot encoded. For details, see the Appendix.

We use hyperparameter tuning to find the best possible model. The model
is fit on a training set of `length(unique(sccs$soc_id))` societies with
information on trance and possession in the standard cross-cultural
sample.

## 5. Results on the training sample

Looking back at the table in the previous section, we see that only
about 10% of societies have no trance or possession phenomena. From the
rest, a majority have possession trance in some form. Following
Bourguignon (1968) we can reduce this to a binary: 81 societies have
possession trance, 70 have other forms of trance and possessior or show
neither.

| possession_trance | count |
|:------------------|------:|
| possession trance |    71 |
| other             |    80 |

We compare this with how our best model categorises each society. This
is our model’s confusion matrix. `0` is absence of possession trance,
`1` is presence of possession trance. The rows add up to values in the
original, the columns are the model’s predictions. The last two columns
show the error rate.

| original |   0 |   1 | Error | Rate    |
|:---------|----:|----:|------:|:--------|
| 0        |  68 |  12 |  0.15 | =12/80  |
| 1        |   7 |  64 |  0.10 | =7/71   |
| Total    |  75 |  76 |  0.13 | =19/151 |

    ## X-squared = 85.106, df = 3, p-value < 2.2e-16

The model has an F-measure of 0.87, with a penalty on slightly
overgeneralising possession trance. Though comparisons are hard to make,
this is not particularly accurate for a binary categorisation problem.
We did expect this, though, as it is unlikely that any complex cultural
phenomenon could be reduced to a small number of cross-cultural
predictors.

### 6. Results on the EA data

We can ask the model to make predictions for the entire Ethnographic
Atlas (where trance and possession data are available) – including the
SCCS subset. Generally, you want to separate the training and test sets
in Machine Learning and not do this, but the ‘everything except the
SCCS’ subset of the Atlas would be an odd test set.

Here is the confusion matrix for all 658 societies in the Atlas where
trance and possession information are available:

| possession_trance_present |   0 |   1 |
|--------------------------:|----:|----:|
|                         0 | 264 | 113 |
|                         1 |  87 | 194 |

    ## 
    ##  Chi-squared test for given probabilities
    ## 
    ## data:  c(c(264, 113), c(87, 194))
    ## X-squared = 118.11, df = 3, p-value < 2.2e-16

The F-measue of this model is 0.66. Accuracy here is much worse than for
the training data only. That is at least partly because the model is
ignorant of the phylogenetic signal which might result in patterns that
are unexpected from a purely correlational point of view. However, the
model is still more accurate than it would be by chance.

We take a look at the variables that were most important in the model in
predicting the presence of possession trance in a given society, with a
cutoff of 10/47.

| ID    | Name                                            | relative_importance |
|:------|:------------------------------------------------|--------------------:|
| EA070 | Slavery: type                                   |               75.60 |
| EA008 | Domestic organization                           |               60.69 |
| EA078 | Norms of premarital sexual behavior of girls    |               48.41 |
| EA066 | Class differentiation: primary                  |               47.78 |
| EA033 | Jurisdictional hierarchy beyond local community |               38.08 |
| EA030 | Settlement patterns                             |               33.61 |
| EA034 | Religion: high gods                             |               23.14 |
| EA023 | Cousin marriages permitted                      |               21.12 |
| EA074 | Inheritance rule for real property (land)       |               19.86 |
| EA031 | Mean size of local communities                  |               17.13 |

We now look at the direction of these effects (does e.g. increased
jurisdictional hierarchy go with more or less prevalent possession
trance?).

The figure below shows the proportion of societies with possession
trance (dark blue) and without (light blue) across the ordered levels of
the predictors that the model thinks are important. They come in order
of how important they are, according to the model; prevalence of
slavery, then family organisation, and so on. The predictor levels are
ordered according to coding and generally go from a pattern being less
prevalent (top) to more prevalent (bottom):

Ee see a clear correlation between the presence of possession trance and
the variable scaling up, e.g. societies in which slavery is more
prevalent have more possession trance than those where it is less
prevalent. The across-level distributions are also interesting, e.g. the
main distinction for patterns of slavery is for societies without
slavery (first factor level) and all others with some form of slavery
(subsequent factor levels).

## 7. Summary

These results go some way in confirming hypotheses on the cross-cultural
correlates of possession trance in the literature. Bourguignon (1968)
explicitly tests the variables of slavery, jurisdictional hierarchy,
settlement patterns, and kin groups. Shaara (1992) point to a high value
placed on female virginity at marriage, captured here by norms of
premarital sexual behaviour for girls, C. P. Wood and Stockly (2018)
point to the role of moralising high gods. These are all important
variables in our model. Greenbaum (1973) and Shaara (1992) point to
sexual division of labour but this is not relevant in our model.

Note that Shaara (1992) use cognatic kinship as a proxy of social
complexity (which in itself is robustly supported by our model) while
the measure referenced by C. P. Wood and Stockly (2018), the presence of
moralising high gods, has in itself been argued to correlate with social
complexity (see Botero et al. (2014) and Watts et al. (2015)).

This brings us back to the original predictions in the table above.

We can predict some types of trance and possession phenomena in the SCCS
subset of the EA. Not all of them. Some of the important co-variates are
the ones mentioned by earlier work and the direction of the
relationships corroborates the literature.

Human society is complicated and cross-cultural data have very low
resolution. In this sense, we’d be very suspect of a model that would be
too accurate of predicting possession trance from societal covariates.
It cannot replace fieldwork and more complex explanatory models either.
What it can do is provide an extra leg for such explanatory work, which
is broadly the recognised ambition of cross-cultural comparative work in
evolutionary anthropology.

Our approach is statistically strict, so the fact that it still shows
some accuracy is definitely promising for the validity of the
connections drawn by previous work on trance and possession phenomena in
particular and large cross-cultural comparisons in general.

| The number of jurisdictional levels in the local community, with 2 representing the theoretical minimum (e.g., independent nuclear or polygynous families) and 4 representing the theoretical maximum (e.g., nuclear families nested within extended families and clan-barrios). See the variable ““Jurisdictional hierarchy beyond the local community”” for information on organization beyond the local community. Note that different types of organization on the same level, e.g., a consanguineal lineage and its localized equivalent, are counted as one, and organizations not held to be legitimate, e.g., imposed colonial regimes, are excluded.                   | EA032 | Jurisdictional hierarchy of local community     | Extended families, Independent families, Missing data, Clan-barrios                                                                                                                                                         |
| The number of jurisdictional levels beyond the local community, with 1 representing the theoretical minimum (e.g., none/autonomous bands or villages) and 4 representing the theoretical maximum (e.g., villages nested within parishes, districts, provinces, and a complex state). This variable also provides a measure of political complexity, ranging from 1 for stateless societies, through 2 or 3 for petty and larger paramount chiefdoms or their equivalent, to 4 or 5 for large states.

### Recoded values in the Ethnographic Atlas

The recoded values were used in the model for each predictor. Where the
recoded values are numeric, the predictor was used as an ordered factor.
Where the recoded values are strings, the predictor was one-hot encoded
(such that predictor A with levels 1, 2, and 3 was turned into boolean
predictors A==2 and A==3).
