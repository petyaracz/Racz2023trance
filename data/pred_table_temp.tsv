EA008	Domestic organization	The prevailing form of domestic or familial organization.
EA012	Marital residence with kin: prevailing pattern	The prevailing profile of marital residence in the society.
EA015	Community marriage organization	The prevalence of local endogamy, agamy, and exogamy, together with the presence or absence of localized kin groups. The specific structure of clans, whether ambilocal, matrilocal, or patrilocal, is revealed by the variable describing prevailing patterns of residence with kin.
EA023	Cousin marriages permitted	The rules or practices governing the marriageability or nonmarriageability of a man's first cousins and, in some cases, second cousins.
EA030	Settlement patterns	The prevailing type of settlement pattern.
EA031	Mean size of local communities	The average population of local communities, whatever the pattern of settlement, computed from census data or other evidence.
EA032	Jurisdictional hierarchy of local community	The number of jurisdictional levels in the local community, with 2 representing the theoretical minimum (e.g., independent nuclear or polygynous families) and 4 representing the theoretical maximum (e.g., nuclear families nested within extended families and clan-barrios). See the variable """"Jurisdictional hierarchy beyond the local community"""" for information on organization beyond the local community. Note that different types of organization on the same level, e.g., a consanguineal lineage and its localized equivalent, are counted as one, and organizations not held to be legitimate, e.g., imposed colonial regimes, are excluded.
EA033	Jurisdictional hierarchy beyond local community	The number of jurisdictional levels beyond the local community, with 1 representing the theoretical minimum (e.g.,  none/autonomous bands or villages) and 4 representing the theoretical maximum (e.g., villages nested within parishes, districts, provinces, and a complex state). This variable also provides a measure of political complexity, ranging from 1 for stateless societies, through 2 or 3 for petty and larger paramount chiefdoms or their equivalent, to 4 or 5 for large states. Note that different types of organization on the same level are counted as one, and organizations not held to be legitimate, e.g., imposed colonial regimes, are excluded.
EA034	Religion: high gods	The range of beliefs in high gods. A high god is defined, following Swanson, as a spiritual being who is believed to have created all reality and/or to be its ultimate governor, even if his sole act was to create other spirits who, in turn, created or control the natural world.
EA042	Subsistence economy: dominant activity	Dominant mode of subsistence (note: not in original EA; derived from other variables on subsistence and type of agriculture).
EA043	Descent: major type	Major mode of descent (note: not in original EA; derived from variables describing patrilineal and matrilineal kin groups EA017, EA019 and EA021).
EA053	Sex differences: animal husbandry	Specialization by sex in animal husbandry.
EA054	Sex differences: agriculture	Specialization by sex in agriculture.
EA066	Class differentiation: primary	The degree and type of class differentiation, excluding purely political and religious statuses. See also """"Class differentiation: secondary,"""" as some societies exhibit important features of two different types of class differentation.
EA068	Caste differentiation: primary	The degree and type of caste differentiation. See also """"Caste differentiation: secondary,"""" as some societies exhibit important features of two different types of caste differentation.
EA070	Slavery: type	The forms and prevalence of slave status, treated quite independently of both class and caste status.
EA072	Political succession	Rules of succession applying to the office of local headman (or a close equivalent), without reference to rules of succession prevailing on higher levels of political integration.

EA074	Inheritance rule for real property (land)	The rule or practice governing the disposition or transmission of a man's property in land (exclusive of any dower right of his widow). [Note that Murdock (1963a) warned that the codes for this variable had """"proved inadequate and in serious need of revision,"""" and that the coded data """"should consequently be used only with circumspection""""].
EA078	Norms of premarital sexual behavior of girls	Prevailing standards of sex behavior for unmarried women.
EA113	Societal rigidity	Degree of rigidity in social structures. Considers stratification of society, whether status distinctions are earned or ascribed, degree of hierarchy of political system, extent to which residence and group membership are fixed, centralization of authority, flexibility of religious rites.
